## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from grpo import GRPOAgent, GRPOTrainer

# Create agent
agent = GRPOAgent(
    state_dim=4,
    action_dim=2,
    lr=3e-4,
    group_robustness_weight=0.2
)

# Create trainer with custom group assignment
trainer = GRPOTrainer(
    env_name="CartPole-v1",
    agent=agent,
    group_assignment_fn=your_group_function
)

# Train
training_history = trainer.train(num_episodes=1000)
```

### Group Assignment

Define custom group assignment functions:

```python
def custom_group_assignment(state, episode):
    # Assign groups based on state features
    if state[0] < 0:
        return 0  # Group A
    else:
        return 1  # Group B
```

## Algorithm Overview

GRPO extends PPO by incorporating group robustness into the policy optimization objective:

- **Standard PPO Loss**: Optimizes average performance across all experiences
- **Group Robust Loss**: Focuses on worst-performing group to ensure fairness
- **Combined Objective**: Balances standard performance with group robustness

## Parameters

- `group_robustness_weight`: Controls the trade-off between average and worst-group performance (0.0 = standard PPO, 1.0 = fully robust)
- `eps_clip`: PPO clipping parameter
- `gamma`: Discount factor
- `lr`: Learning rate

## 📚 Examples & Applications

## 🔬 Research & Technical Details

### Algorithm Innovation
GRPO extends PPO with a **dual-objective optimization**:

```python
# Combined loss balances efficiency and fairness
total_loss = (1 - λ) × standard_ppo_loss + λ × group_robust_loss

# Where group_robust_loss focuses on worst-performing demographic
group_robust_loss = max(group_losses)  # Minimax fairness
```

### Key Parameters
- **`group_robustness_weight` (λ)**: Fairness vs efficiency trade-off (0.0 = PPO, 1.0 = max fairness)
- **`eps_clip`**: PPO clipping parameter for policy updates
- **`gamma`**: Discount factor for future rewards
- **`lr`**: Learning rate for neural network optimization
