# Claude Memory for GRPO Healthcare Project

## Project Overview
This is a Group Robust Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation focused on healthcare resource allocation. The project demonstrates AI fairness in critical healthcare applications by ensuring equitable treatment across different patient demographics.

## Current Status
- âœ… Basic GRPO algorithm implementation complete
- âœ… Core framework with policy/value networks and training pipeline
- âœ… Simple CartPole example working
- ðŸš§ Currently implementing: Healthcare resource allocation example

## Healthcare Implementation Goals
- Create realistic hospital environment simulation
- Implement fair resource allocation across patient demographics
- Add comprehensive fairness metrics and analysis
- Demonstrate ethical AI principles in healthcare

## Key Technical Details
- **Algorithm**: GRPO (extends PPO with group robustness)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Environment**: Custom hospital simulation
- **Groups**: Patient demographics (pediatric, adult, elderly, critical care)
- **Fairness Objective**: Ensure no demographic group has significantly worse outcomes
