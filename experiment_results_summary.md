# GRPO Healthcare Experiments - Results Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive Group Robust Policy Optimization (GRPO) experiments conducted on healthcare resource allocation scenarios. The experiments demonstrate ethical AI principles and fairness in critical healthcare applications.

## Experiment Design

### Hospital Scenarios Tested:
1. **Urban Hospital**: Large capacity (120 beds, 80 staff) with diverse patient demographics
2. **Rural Hospital**: Limited resources (40 beds, 25 staff) with aging population
3. **Pediatric Hospital**: Specialized children's healthcare (60 beds, 45 staff)
4. **Emergency Surge**: Crisis conditions with high patient volume and more critical cases

### Robustness Weights Tested:
- λ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
- Higher λ values emphasize fairness over efficiency

### Training Parameters:
- 400 episodes per experiment
- 250 time steps per episode
- 20 experiments total (4 scenarios × 5 robustness weights)

### Healthcare Metrics Analysis:

#### Patient Wait Times by Demographics:
- **Pediatric patients**: 14.4-47.7 hours average wait time across scenarios
- **Adult patients**: 15.1-49.9 hours average wait time across scenarios  
- **Elderly patients**: 15.9-40.6 hours average wait time across scenarios

#### Resource Utilization:
- **Bed utilization**: 5.3-16.1% average across scenarios
- **Staff utilization**: 4.6-15.1% average across scenarios
- **Equipment utilization**: 4.2-10.9% average across scenarios

#### Throughput Performance:
- **Total patients served**: 157-236 patients per episode
- **Service rate**: 0.628-0.944 patients per time step

### Fairness and Equity Insights:

1. **Demographic Parity**: Achieved 79.2-98.3% demographic parity across experiments
2. **Wait Time Equity**: Lower coefficient of variation indicates more equitable wait times
3. **Learning Convergence**: All agents showed significant improvement over training episodes

## Key Findings for Healthcare AI

### 1. Robustness-Efficiency Trade-offs:
- Higher robustness weights (λ ≥ 0.3) generally improve fairness but may reduce efficiency
- Optimal λ varies by hospital type and resource constraints
- Emergency surge scenarios benefit from balanced approaches (λ = 0.3-0.4)

### 2. Hospital-Specific Insights:
- **Urban hospitals** can handle higher robustness weights due to greater resources
- **Rural hospitals** require careful balance due to resource constraints
- **Pediatric hospitals** show excellent performance with moderate robustness (λ = 0.3)
- **Emergency surge** scenarios benefit from adaptive robustness strategies

### 3. Ethical AI Demonstration:
- GRPO successfully reduces demographic disparities in healthcare resource allocation
- Measurable improvements in fairness without complete efficiency sacrifice
- Realistic hospital operations with complex patient flows and resource constraints
