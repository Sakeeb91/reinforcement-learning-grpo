# 📊 GRPO Healthcare Visualization Overview

## 🎨 Available Visualizations (No CUDA Required!)

Our GRPO healthcare system generates comprehensive visualizations that run entirely on **CPU** - no GPU or CUDA needed!

## 📈 1. Healthcare Dashboard
**File**: `healthcare_dashboard.png`

A comprehensive 6-panel dashboard showing:

### Panel 1: Training Progress 🚀
- **4 learning curves** for different hospital scenarios
- Shows how each agent improves over 600 episodes
- **Urban Hospital**: Steady learning, high final performance
- **Rural Hospital**: Resource-constrained learning pattern
- **Pediatric Hospital**: Specialized fairness optimization
- **Emergency Surge**: Crisis-optimized performance

### Panel 2: Final Performance Comparison 🏆
- Bar chart comparing final reward scores
- Color-coded by hospital type
- Shows which scenarios achieve best overall performance

### Panel 3: Reward vs Fairness Trade-off ⚖️
- **Scatter plot** with each point representing a hospital scenario
- X-axis: Average Reward (efficiency)
- Y-axis: Fairness Score (equity)
- Color: Robustness Weight (λ parameter)
- **Key Insight**: Higher robustness weights improve fairness

### Panel 4: Robustness Weight Impact 📊
- **Dual-axis line plot** showing trade-offs
- Blue line: How robustness weight affects performance
- Red line: How robustness weight affects fairness
- Shows optimal balance point for each scenario

### Panel 5: Fairness Distribution 🎻
- **Violin plots** showing fairness score distributions
- Demonstrates consistency of fair treatment
- Wider distributions = more variable fairness

### Panel 6: Demographic Wait Time Heatmap ⏱️
- **Color-coded matrix** showing average wait times
- Rows: Patient demographics (Pediatric, Adult, Elderly, Critical)
- Columns: Hospital scenarios
- **Darker colors = longer waits**
- Shows GRPO's success in equalizing wait times

## 📊 2. Performance Summary Table
**File**: `performance_summary.png`

Professional summary table with:
- **Hospital Scenario**: Type of healthcare setting
- **Robustness Weight**: Fairness optimization parameter
- **Final Reward**: Overall performance score
- **Fairness Score**: Demographic equity measure
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal treatment across groups
- **Wait Time Disparity**: Difference in wait times between groups

**Color Coding**:
- 🟢 **Green**: Excellent fairness (≥0.8)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Good fairness (0.6-0.8)
- 🔴 **Red**: Needs improvement (<0.6)

## 📈 3. Individual Training Curves
**File**: `individual_training_curves.png`

Detailed 2x2 grid showing each hospital scenario:

### Urban Hospital (λ=0.3)
- **High capacity, balanced demographics**
- Steady learning curve with good final performance
- Moderate fairness optimization

### Rural Hospital (λ=0.4)
- **Resource-constrained environment**
- More volatile learning due to limited resources
- Higher fairness emphasis due to rural healthcare equity needs

### Pediatric Hospital (λ=0.2)
- **Child-focused specialized care**
- Lower robustness weight (children naturally prioritized)
- Consistent performance with built-in fairness

### Emergency Surge (λ=0.5)
- **Crisis management scenario**
- Highest robustness weight for ethical triage
- Shows GRPO's ability to maintain fairness under pressure

## 🎯 Key Insights from Visualizations

### 1. **Fairness-Performance Trade-off**
- Higher robustness weights (λ) improve fairness but may reduce raw performance
- Sweet spot around λ=0.3-0.4 for most scenarios

### 2. **Scenario-Specific Optimization**
- Emergency scenarios benefit most from high fairness weights
- Pediatric hospitals can use lower weights (inherent priority)
- Rural hospitals need higher weights due to resource constraints

### 3. **Demographic Equity Achievement**
- GRPO successfully reduces wait time disparities across age groups
- Critical patients maintain priority while ensuring fairness for others
- Statistical significance in fairness improvements

### 4. **Learning Stability**
- All scenarios achieve stable learning
- Fairness scores improve consistently during training
- No catastrophic fairness failures observed
